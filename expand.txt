Possible improvements:
- Count to another number than 10, configurable by user (TTS via IBM Watson or custom recordings)
- Make thresholds configurable for the user.
- Use a neural network with inputs such as pitch, interval between breaths and volume to get a better indication of when a seizure is starting.
